```

The actual data file has more than 17000 variables. We'll use the meta-data file to select the variable of interest, and use the `ff_vars` vector to subset the actual data file.

For this project, we're interested in:

1. Demographic characteristics 
a. self-reported race/ethnicity at age 15
b. mother's report on gender at birth

2. Scales:
a. Self-Description Questionnaire (SDQ) - Information on internalizing and externalizing behaviors at age 9
b. Delinquent Behavior Scale at age 9 and age 15
c. Aggravation in parenting - collected for Baseline all years

3. Outcomes from questionnaire
a. If child suspended/expelled, and number of times suspended or expelled at age 9 (parent report) and at age 15 (parent and child)


```{r}
#select scales
scales <- c("Aggravation in Parents", 
            "Self-Description Questionnaire (SDQ)",
            "Delinquent Behavior") 

ff_meta_subset <- ff_meta %>% 
                #demographic characteristics - race/ethnicity
                filter((topics == "Demographics" &
                        str_detect(varlab,"self-description of race/ethnicity"))|
                        #gender
                        (subtopics == "sex/gender" &
                        str_detect(varlab, "Focal baby's gender"))|
                        #scales
                        scale %in% scales|
                        #outcomes from questionnaire
                        (source == "questionnaire" & 
                        subtopics == "student experiences" &
                        str_detect(varlab,"suspen")))%>% 
                #only include relevant columns
                select(new_name, varlab, topics, subtopics, 
                       type, scale, source, respondent, 
                       survey, wave,
                       starts_with("label"))

```

Our meta-data subset includes the following information:

a. variable names corresponding to columns in the actual data set
b. variable labels - actual question statement
c. topics
d. subtopic
e. type - types of variable (continuous, categorical, etc.)
f. scale - which scale was used. "" means no scale was used
g. source 
h. respondent
i. survey
j. wave - year and wave data was collected
k. starts_with("label") - description of possible responses to questions and how they're coded.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
#use variable names to subset the dataset

ff_vars <- ff_meta_subset$new_name

ff <- import(here("data","FF_allwaves_2020v2_SPSS.sav")) %>% 
    clean_names()

ff_sub <- ff %>% 
    select(idnum, #identifier 
           all_of(ff_vars)) %>%  #our selected variables
    as_tibble()

```

```{r}
#let's save the subsetted df so that we don't have to clean each time

#export(ff_sub, here("data","ff_sub.Rda"))

ff_sub <- import(here("data","ff_sub.Rda"))
```

The variables (columns) have the following attributes:

a. label: variable label
b. names: possible responses for a question

```{r}
#let's join the meta data to the subset so that we know which scale it comes from

ff_sub_long <- ff_sub %>% 
    pivot_longer(
        cols = -1,
        names_to = "response"
    ) %>% 
    left_join(ff_meta, by = c("response" = "new_name"))

```


```{r}
#Let's make some example plots

plots <- ff_sub_long %>% 
    filter(scale == "Self-Description Questionnaire (SDQ)" & value >=0) %>%
    nest_by(varlab) %>% 
    summarise(
        plot = list(
            ggplot(data, aes(x = as.factor(value)))+
            geom_bar()+
            labs(
                title = glue::glue("{varlab}")
            )   
        )
    )

walk(plots$plot,print)
